# zstd-rs Benchmark

Source CSV: `benchmarks/reports/zstd-bench-compare-level1-unknown-samestart-offset-vsretained-fast.csv`

Commentary: Large Unknown Fastest path: prefer same-start smaller non-repeat offsets when they save at least 2 offset-code bits for at most 1 byte of match loss.

Percent improvements compare new/current against upstream. Each compressed output is decoded with C zstd and byte-compared against the original fixture.
